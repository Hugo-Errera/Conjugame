# Conjugame

I made this game to learn french conjugations, feel free to use it.

The verbs here are the ones my teacher asked me to learn, you can change the lists of verbs to the ones you want to learn.

The graphic interface is better suited to my resolution but should work in most computers.

I would love any feedback on how to improve the game 👍🏻👍🏻
